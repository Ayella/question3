A declaration for an array for  50 type long values..
 Long values[50];
 
 
 
 Statement  to assign the value 123456 to 50th element...
 Long values[49]= 123456;
 
 for (x = 0; x < 100; x++)
 x is 100
 
 
 for(ctr = 2; ctr < 10; ctr += 3)
 ctr is 11
 
  a while statement to count from 1 to 100 by 3s
  #include<stdio.h>
  main()
  {
  int count = 1;
  while(count<=100)
  { printf("%d",count);
  count+=3;
  }
  }
  
  for (counter = 1; counter < MAXVALUES; counter++ );
    printf("\nCounter = %d", counter);
    The semicolon terminating the for loop causes the the code under the for loop to be executed once  outside of the for loop.
